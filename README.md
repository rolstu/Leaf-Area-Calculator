## üìñ How to Use

Maximize the potential of the Leaf Area Calculator with these easy steps:

1. **Prepare Your Leaves**: Place each leaf on a plain white piece of paper, ensuring they do not overlap.
2. **Scan**: Digitally scan your prepared leaves, capturing their essence for analysis.
3. **Input**: Input the folder containing your scanned images into the application.

### Important Notes:

- **Background**: The white paper serves as a crucial contrast background. Only use plain white paper without any other objects or materials present.
- **Accuracy**: The app distinguishes leaf areas by contrasting against the white background. Ensure no other items are on the paper to avoid inaccurate measurements.

## üå± Get Started

This script is open for everyone, aiming to help researchers, students, and hobbyists alike.

Open de ***.exe file***, or run the ***.py script***. It will appear a GUI with two inputs: The folder dir containing you well scanned images and the directory where **you want to save your .csv file** 

*REMEMBER TO FINISH YOUR DIRECTORY WITH .CSV* such as "https://github.com/rolstu/Leaf-Area-Calculator/releases"

That's it! Waste no more time doing each image by hand.
